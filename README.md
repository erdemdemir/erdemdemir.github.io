As a former pharmacist and current clinical trials professional, I enjoy developing tools that can be useful to others. The vast majority of them never make it out of my head, but here are a few that managed to escape:

## Automation

[LOCALE](https://github.com/erdemdemir/locale): A tool to automate the localization of clinical trial templates with site-specific values and logos.

## Communication

[Using GPT-4 for translating clinical trials texts to plain language for general public](https://github.com/erdemdemir/plainlanguage): This guide showcases how to effectively use AI prompting techniques to simplify complex clinical trial documents, making them more accessible to the general public.

[Eczaneler için İngilizce Dil Kılavuzu](https://github.com/erdemdemir/dilkilavuzu): This guide is designed for Turkish pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to enhance their English communication skills in pharmacy settings.
